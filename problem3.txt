Explain Algorithm in a way a child could understand

An algorithm is a series of steps a computer can make to solve a simple task.

For instance, if we wanted to convert letters to numbers, we could use an algorithm to do so.

The algorithm would need to do the steps in order. First we would define the numerical values of the numbers.

We'd tell the computer first, that A = 1, B = 2, and so on.

Next we would input the word we want to convert. Maybe the word is Word.

Then the computer would compare the Word, Word, to the numerical equivilents, and then finally output the result.

Word = 23 15 18 4
